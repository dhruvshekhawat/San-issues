# sanitizer-issues

This repository highlights some of the issues with sanitizers(address, memory and thread) and cases where they report false positives or false negatives. To recreate such errors and warnings, run 


```./testall.sh```


These issues were found with clang version 3.4 and gcc version (Debian 4.9.2-10). For the impatient ones, go through the issues.txt file.
